// In Dart language, there is only Single Inheritance.
// To share functionalities between classes we can use mixins.
// Mixins are a way of reusing a classâ€™s code in multiple class hierarchies.
// To use a mixin, use the with keyword followed by one or more mixin names.
// Adding features to a class: mixins
